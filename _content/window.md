The number of drug crime decreased over years, however, there is a noticable pattern in the reports of crime.

There are two time slots when most of the crimes were reported: from March to April and from August to November. The gap between April and August is probably caused by summer holidays.

As already noticed, the crime level decreased over time. Below there is a simulation showing monthly crime level from 2003 to 2017.
