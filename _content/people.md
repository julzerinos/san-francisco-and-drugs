# What of the people?

As mentioned in one of the articles, drug addicts outnumber high school students 1.5 times. Considering that drug-related crimes are commited, in most cases, by the same group of people, we can compare the average yearly crime number to San Francisco's population.

It is noticable that the population number is much higher, but only around 50% of people are aged between 18 and 65, therefore drug addicts make up 0.5% of the working population.
