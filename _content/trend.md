# What is the trend?

Taking a look at the yearly trend of total reports in the drug and narcotic category, we get a slightly different perspective. Clearly, after 2009, the total number of reports fall nearly twicefold.

There is a visible drop in drug crime after 2009. Referring to the articles mentioned earlier, there is a visible drop in and after 2014 - the year heroin possesion was demoted criminally.

It's important to take a look at the big picture. While it is true that drug reports fell, the total number of crimes rose.

So while it is plausible that the approach to drugs remained liberal with lukewarm drug abuse counter-strategies implemented, the general increase in crime rate certainly did not help the police department maintain control in the drug/narcotic category.

The number of drug crime decreased over years, however, there is a noticable pattern in the reports of crime.

There are two time slots when most of the crimes were reported: from March to April and from August to November. The gap between April and August is probably caused by summer holidays.

As mentioned in one of the articles, drug addicts outnumber high school students 1.5 times. Considering that drug-related crimes are commited, in most cases, by the same group of people, we can compare the average yearly crime number to San Francisco's population.

It is noticable that the population number is much higher, but only around 50% of people are aged between 18 and 65, therefore drug addicts make up 0.5% of the working population. 

As already noticed, the crime level decreased over time. Below there is a simulation showing monthly crime level from 2003 to 2017.
