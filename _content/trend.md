# What is the trend?

Taking a look at the yearly trend of total reports in the drug and narcotic category, we get a slightly different perspective. Clearly, after 2009, the total number of reports fall nearly twicefold.

There is a visible drop in drug crime after 2009. Referring to the articles mentioned earlier, there is a visible drop in and after 2014 - the year heroin possesion was demoted criminally.

It's important to take a look at the big picture. While it is true that drug reports fell, the total number of crimes rose.

So while it is plausible that the approach to drugs remained liberal with lukewarm drug abuse counter-strategies implemented, the general increase in crime rate certainly did not help the police department maintain control in the drug/narcotic category.
