# Introduction

This is a data report commenting on and visualizing the relationship between drug-related crimes and San Francisco over the course of 14 years. 

The data used for this report is sourced from the San Francisco Police Department via the [Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry) data set.

This data set is a collection of reportted crime incidents with (among others) key report information about the crime, such as:
 - data and time of the crime
 - location (in the lat/long system)
 - crime category and description

 As part of this report, we will be focused on the `DRUG/NARCOTIC` category and the time period between January 1st 2003 and December 31st 2017.
