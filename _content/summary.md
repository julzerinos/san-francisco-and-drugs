# Summary

The city of San Francisco has been struggling over the years with the high rate of drug-related crimes. While drug reports have decreased by threefold from 2003 to 2017, it is unclear if this is due to success in drug abuse strategies applied by SF's authorities and police or simply a new "normal" in the approach to drug users in the city.

However, the observed pattern of crime recording would indicate insufficient patrols during holiday periods. Although, the number of drug crimes seems to be quite high, this problem affects only about 0.5% of the working population. 

The Tenderloin disctrict has been said to be the epicenter of the drug activity, even so, over the years, increased drug activity has spread to adjacent neighbourhoods, sometimes observing even higher level of crime there. Given the districts long history with drugs, it is not a surprise that the location is being used by the authorities as ground zero for battling drug abuse in the city.
